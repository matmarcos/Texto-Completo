\section{Introduction} 

Let $L$ be a Lie algebra and $d$ be a derivation of $L$. The derivation $d$ is non-singular if is injective as linear transformation. We are interested in studying what information we can obtain about a Lie algebra if it has a nonsingular derivation. Jacobson's famous theorem \cite{Jacobson} states that a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero that admits a non-singular derivation must be nilpotent. It is well-known that this theorem is not valid is not valid when the characteristic is non-zero. Non-nilpotent and solvable examples were constructed by Shalev~\cite{Shalev} and Mattarei~\cite{Mattarei}, whereas the simple Lie algebras with non-singular derivations were classified by Benkart and her collaborators in~\cite{Benkart}. 
 A significant application of non-singular derivation was presented by Shalev \cite{Shalev2}. In his proof of coclass conjectures of Leddham-Green and Newman for pro-$p$ groups, Shalev uses that finite-dimensional Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $p>0$ with non-singular derivation $d$ such that $d^{p-1}=1$, must be nilpotent. 
 
Despite the existing examples, little is known about non-nilpotent Lie algebras with non-singular derivations. In these notes we explore the structure of solvable, non-nilpotent Lie algebras with non-singular derivations. In order to study this algebras we develop a theory of the derivations of Lie algebra extensions. We adopt the concept of a compatible pair of automorphisms introduced in~\cite{Eick} for derivations of Lie algebras. 

Let $K$ and $I$ be Lie algebras such that $K$ acts on $I$, then we can define a subalgebra $\comp L I$ of derivations of semi-direct sum $K \sdsum I$ $$
  \comp KI=\{\alpha+\beta\in\gl K\oplus\gl I\mid
  \alpha+\beta\in\der{K\sdsum I}\}.$$ The algebra $\der K$ carries information about the multiplicative structure of $K$. Analogously, the algebra $\comp K I$ carries information about the action of $K$ on $I$. In section \ref{secJacobson} we present an example of this by exploring the proof of Jacobson's Theorem and we prove a version for Lie algebras representations over a field of characteristic  $p>0$. 

\textbf{Theorem \ref{1.8}} \textit{ Let $K$ and $I$ be finite dimensional Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $p$ such that $K$ is nilpotent. Suppose that $K$ act on $I$ by representation $\psi:K \to \der I$. Let $(\alpha, \beta) \in \comp K I$ such that $\alpha$ has no eigenvalue 0. If either $p=0$ or $p>0$ and dimension of $I$ is less than $p$ then $Tr(\psi^n(k))=0$, for all $k \in K$. In these two cases, $\psi(k)$ is nilpotent.}

We also adapt an algorithm presented by Bettina Eick \cite{Eick} for calculating the automorphism group of solvable Lie algebras. A key step in the algorithm is the following. Let $L$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ an abelian ideal of $L$ such that $I$ is invariant by $Aut(L)$. Then there exists a homomorphism $\phi: Aut(L) \to Aut(L/I) \times Aut(I)$ induced by the actions of $Aut(L)$ on $L/I$ and $I$. The image of $\phi$ can be calculated using $Aut(L/I)$, while $\ker \phi $ is equal to $\zone K I$. Then the group $Aut(L)$ can be obtained applying the first isomorphism theorem to $\phi$. It is possible to use this process to derivations.

Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ be a $K$-module. Let $\ztwo K I $ be the vector space of cocycles and $\comp K I$ the subalgebra of compatible pairs. Let $(\alpha, \beta) \in \comp KI$ and $\vartheta \in \ztwo KI$. Define an action of $\comp K I$ over $\ztwo K I $ by 
\begin{center}
$(\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta(h,k)=\beta(\vartheta(h,k))-\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)-\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)), \quad \mbox{ for all } h,k \in K.$
\end{center}
The elements of annihilator of this action will be called induced pairs and we denote the set of induced pairs by $\indu K I \vartheta$. Let $\vartheta \in \ztwo K I$ a cocycle and $K_\theta$ be the Lie algebra extension obtained from $K$ by $\vartheta$. Then we can lift the derivation of $\indu K I \vartheta$ to $Der(K_\theta)$. Thus we obtained the following theorem.

\textbf{Theorem  \ref{DerExt}} \textit{ Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Let $\vartheta \in \htwo KI$ and suppose  that $I$, as ideal of $K_\vartheta$, invariant under derivations of $K_\vartheta$. Let $\phi:\der {K_\vartheta} \to \der K \oplus \der I$ given by $\phi(d)=(\alpha,\beta)$. Then:
  \begin{enumerate}
 \item $\im \phi=  \indu K I \vartheta$
  \item $\ker \phi \cong  \zone KI$
  \end{enumerate}}
  
The details of this construction can be seen in Section \ref{extensions}. There is a significant difference between the application of this approach to automorphisms and to derivations: calculating the automorphism groups of a Lie algebra is usually a difficult task that may involve a large orbit-stabilizer calculation, while calculating the algebra $\der {K_\vartheta}$ can be done by solving a system of linear equations. Thus, to understand the importance of Theorem \ref{DerExt} we must discover whose additional information of $\der {K_\vartheta}$ we are able to obtain through information of algebras $\der{K}$ and $\der I$.
  
 In order facilitate the reading of the text and the references, we added a section with results on the decomposition of vector spaces in relation to subalgebras of linear operators and a brief description of the main articles used. 
  
 This text is organized as follows: section 2 is dedicated to literature review. In Section 3, we present compatible pairs and the lifting process of derivations of a Lie algebra $K$ to the Lie algebras $K_{\vartheta}$ such that $\vartheta$ is a cocycle. We end this section by applying the compatible pairs to Jacobson's Theorem. The Section 4 is composed of some examples and conjectures about modular solvable non-nilpotent Lie algebras with non-singular derivations.
 
\section{Non-singular derivations: known results} This section is composed by description of a decomposition of a Lie algebra $L$ relative to a subalgebra $K$ of $\gl L$ and it utilization in Jacobson's theorem. Next, we have the calculations of Shalev article \cite{Shalev} about conditions on the order of derivation which guarantees nilpotency of a Lie algebra. It finishes with Mattarei theorem that relates the order of derivations of solvable modular Lie algebra with non-singular derivation with roots of some polynomials.


\subsection{Basic concepts} 

Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over field $\F$ and $a \in \ennd V$. Let $p \in \F[X]$ be a univariate polynomial and define $$V_0(p(a))=\{v \in V \mid  \mbox{ there is an } m>0  \mbox{ such that } p(a)^mv=0\}.$$ 
 $V_0(p(a))$ is a vector subspace of $V$ invariant under $a$. Now let $A$ be the associative algebra with 1 generated by $a$. Let  $p_a$ be the minimum polynomial of $a$ and suppose that  $$p_a=p_1^{k_1} \cdots p_r^{k_r}$$ is the factorization of $p_a$ into irreducible factors, such that $p_i$ has leading coefficient 1 and $p_i \neq p_j$ for $1 \leq i, j \leq r$. Then $V$ decomposes as a direct sum of subspaces $$V=V_0(p_1(a)) \oplus \cdots \oplus V_0(p_r(a)),$$ each space $V_0(p_i(a))$ being invariant under $A$. Furthermore, the minimum polynomial of the restriction of $a$ to $V_0(p_i(a))$ is $p_i^{k_i}$. A proof of this result can be found in \cite{deGraaf} Lemma A.2.2.   
 
We can generalize this decomposition, instead of us consider an element $a \in \ennd V$ we can consider a subalgebra $K \leq \gl V$. A decomposition $V = V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_s$ of $V$ into $K$-modules $V_i$ is said to be primary if the minimum polynomial of the restriction of $a$ to $V_i$ is a power of an irreducible polynomial for all $a \in K$ and $1 \leq i \leq s$. The subspaces $V_i$ are called primary components. If for any two components $V_i$ and $V_j$ $(i \neq j)$, there is an $x \in K$ such that the minimum polynomials of the restrictions of $x$ to $V_i$ and $V_j$ are powers of different irreducible polynomials then the decomposition is called collected. In general $V$ will not have a primary (or primary collected) decomposition into $K-$modules but it is guaranteed if the base field of $V$ is algebraically closed and $K \leq \gl V$ is nilpotent. 

\begin{prop} Let $V$ be a vector space of finite-dimension. Let $K \leq \gl V$ be a nilpotent subalgebra. Then $V$ has a unique collected primary decomposition relative to $K$
\end{prop}

A proof of this result can be found in Theorem 3.1.10 of \cite{deGraaf}. 

If the vector space $V$ has a primary collected decomposition $V = V_1 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_s$ then we can characterize the components $V_i$. For $x \in K$ and $1 \leq i \leq s$ define $p_{x,i}$ to be the irreducible polynomial such that the minimum polynomial of $x$ restricted to $V_i$ is a power of $p_{x,i}$. Then $$V_i=\{v \in V \mid  \mbox{ for all } x \in K \mbox{ there is an } m>0  \mbox{ such that }  p_{x,i}(x)^mv=0\}.$$ It is worth noting the case that the base field of $V$ is algebraically closed, then all irreducible polynomials are of the form $p_{x,i}=(X - \lambda_i(x)),$ $ \lambda_i(x) \in \F$ and the primary components are of the form $$V_i=\{v \in V \mid  \mbox{ for all } x \in K \mbox{ there is an } m>0  \mbox{ such that }  (x - \lambda_i(x).Id)^mv=0\},$$ with $\lambda_i \in K^*$. Its natural define a name for this case. Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over field $\F$ and $K \in \gl V $ a subalgebra. Let $\lambda \in K^*$. If $$V_{\lambda}=\{v \in V \mid  \mbox{ for all } x \in K \mbox{ there is an } m>0  \mbox{ such that }  (x - \lambda(x).Id)^mv=0\} \neq 0,$$ then $V_\lambda$ is called generalized eigenspace of $V$ associated to eigenvalue $\lambda \in K^*$.

Now we consider a Lie algebra $L$ and a nilpotent subalgebra $K \leq \der L $. Then the decomposition to generalized eigenspaces of $D$ can provide us some  information of the multiplicative structure of $L$. 

\begin{prop}{\label{1.01}} 
 Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field. Let $K$ be a  subalgebra of $\der L$. If $\lambda,\mu:K \to \F$ are eigenvalues of $K$  then $[L_\lambda,L_{\mu}] \subseteq L_{\lambda+\mu}$ if $\lambda+\mu$ is a  eigenvalue of $K$. Otherwise $[L_{\mu}, L_{\lambda}]=0$.
\end{prop}
A proof of this result can be found Section 2 of Chapter 3 of \cite{JacobsonBook}. 


\subsection{Jacobson Theorem}

 In the article \textit{A note on automorphism and derivations of Lie algebras} \cite{Jacobson}, Jacobson used a variation of Engel's theorem for weakly closed sets to get sufficient conditions for a Lie algebra to be nilpotent. We recommend the reading of the Section 1 and 2 of Chapter 2 of Jacobson's book \cite{JacobsonBook} as reference for examples and proofs.

Let $A$ be an associative algebra with $1$ over a field $\F$. A subset $S$ of $A$ is called weakly closed if for every ordered pair $(a, b)\in S \times S,$ there is an element $\gamma(a,b) \in \F$ such that $ ab+ \gamma (a, b) b a \in M$. If $S$ is a subset of $A$ we denote by $\langle S \rangle$ the subalgebra of $A$ (subalgebra containing 1) generated by $S$. 

\begin{prop}{\label{1.02}} Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field $\F$. Let $S \subseteq \gl V$ be a weakly closed subset such that every $s \in S$ is associative nilpotent, that is, $s^k=0$, for some positive integer $k$. Then the subalgebra $\langle S \rangle$ is nilpotent. 
\end{prop}

A proof of this theorem can be found in Section 1 of Chapter 2 of \cite{JacobsonBook}. With this result we can prove the following theorem.
\begin{teo}{(Jacobson)}{\label{Jacobsontheo}} Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra over a field of characteristic 0 and suppose that there exists a subalgebra $D$ of the algebra of derivations of $L$ such that
\begin{enumerate}
 \item $D$ is nilpotent;
 \item if there is $c \in L$ such that $d(c)=0$ for all $d \in D$ then $c=0$.
\end{enumerate} Then $L$ is nilpotent. 
\end{teo}
\begin{proof} Let $\bar{\F}$ be the algebraic closure of the base field. We can  extend all derivations of $L$ to $\bar{L}=L \otimes \bar{\F}$. If we prove that $\bar{L}$ is nilpotent then $L$ is nilpotent. So we will assume that $\F$ is algebraically closed. In this case the extension of $D$ is nilpotent and without 0 as eigenvalue, i. e.  if there is $c \in L$ such that $d(c)=0$ for all $d \in D$ then $c=0$. Let $L = L_{\gamma_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus L_{\gamma_r}$ be the decomposition of $L$ into generalized eigenspaces of $D$. By Proposition \ref{1.01} we have $[L_{\gamma_i},L_{\gamma_j}] \subseteq L_{\gamma_i+\gamma_j}$ if $\gamma_i+\gamma_j$ is a eigenvalue of $D$ and $[L_{\gamma_i},L_{\gamma_j}]=0$ otherwise. Let $\ad {} {L_{\gamma_j}}$ denote the set of adjoint mappings induced by elements of $L_{\gamma_j}$. Then the relation just noted shows that the set $ S= \bigcup \ad {}{L_{\gamma_j}}$ is a weakly closed set of linear transformations. Let $a \in L_{\gamma_j}$ and $b \in L_{\gamma_i}$. Then $(\ad{}{a})^s(b) \in L_{\gamma_i+s \gamma_j}$, for all $s \geq 0$. By assumption, 0 is not a eigenvalue and so the elements $\{\gamma_i+s\gamma_j\}_{s \geq 0}$ are all distinct. Then for some $r$ greater enough  $(\gamma_i+r\gamma_j)$ is not an eigenvalue and $\ad{}{a}(b)=0$. Follow that $\ad{}{a}$ is nilpotent. Thus every element of $S$ is nilpotent. By Proposition \ref{1.02} we can conclude that the algebra $\langle S \rangle $ is nilpotent and hence $\ad{}{L}$ is nilpotent. Therefore $L$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra.   
\end{proof}

A review of the proof of theorem \ref{Jacobsontheo} shows that the hypothesis of zero characteristic is essential to prove that every element in a homogeneous component is nilpotent. However, we can guarantee this in characteristic $p$ by requiring that $D$ has at most $p-1$ eigenvalues or that dimension of $L$ is less than $p$. This leads to the following corollary fo Jacobson theorem.

\begin{cor}{\label{JacoModp}} Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p>0$ and suppose that there exists a subalgebra $D$ of the algebra of derivations of $L$ such that 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $D$ is nilpotent;
\item if there is $c \in L$ such that $d(c)=0$ for all $d \in D$ then $c=0$.
\end{enumerate} If $D$ has at most $p-1$ eigenvalues then $L$ is nilpotent. 
\end{cor}
One question that arises from the theorem is its validity in characteristic $ p \neq 0$. However this does not happen, we have simple modular Lie algebras with non-singular derivations. For example, let $\F$ be the field of $2^m$ elements and $L$ be the vector space over $\F$ such that $$L= \langle x_\alpha \mid \alpha \in \F, \alpha \neq 0\rangle$$ with a basis labelled by nonzero elements of the field $\F$ and with multiplication $[x_\alpha, x_\beta]=(\beta-\alpha)x_{\alpha+\beta}$. Then $L$ is a simple Lie algebr and the map $d \in \ennd L$ given by $d(e_\alpha)=\alpha e_\alpha$ is a non-singular derivation. A systematic investigation of simple Lie algebras with nonsingular derivations can be found in \cite{Benkart}. Another question is whether the converse is true. By Dixmer and Lister \cite{Dixmier}, there are nilpotent Lie algebras admitting only nilpotent derivations. We present one example of such an algebra: suppose that $\F$ is a field of characteristic 0 and $L$ is the Lie algebra over $\F$ $$L = \langle x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_8 \rangle $$ with dimension 8 and multiplication table 

$[e_1,e_2]=e_5 \quad [e_1,e_3]=e_6  \quad[e_1,e_4]=e_7  \quad [e_1,e_5]=-e_8  \quad [e_2,e_3]=e_8 \quad [e_2,e_4]=e_6 $

$ [e_2,e_6]=-e_7 \quad [e_3,e_4]=-e_5 \quad [e_3,e_5]=-e_7 \quad [e_4,e_6]=-e_8 \quad  [e_i,e_j]=-[e_j,e_i]$

\noindent and $[e_i,e_j]=0$ if it is not in table above. $L$ is nilpotent with $L^3 \neq 0$,  $L^4=0$ and every derivation of $L$ is nilpotent.



\subsection{The orders of non-singular derivations} An interesting approach by  Shalev in article \cite{Shalev} is to study the order of nonsingular derivations, establishing conditions for a Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p$ with non-singular derivations to be nilpotent. More precisely, Shalev studied the set of orders of nonsingular derivations of non-nilpotent Lie algebras of characteristic $p$. Later, Mattarei in \cite{Mattarei} showed that this set of numbers corresponds to the solution of some equation modulo $p$. Below we present some results of these articles.

Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p$. We can characterize the matrix of a non-singular derivation of $L$. We need a result for derivations in Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $p$. 

\begin{prop} Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over a field $\F$ of characteristic $p>0$. If $d \in \der L$ then $d^p \in \der L$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} Let $d \in \der L$ . Then by Leibniz formula $$d^n([x,y])=\sum_{k-0}^n \binom{n}{k}d^k(x)d^{n-k}(y), \mbox{ for all n>0}.$$
Set $n=p$. Then $d^p([x,y])=[d^p(x),y]+[x,d^p(y)]$ and $d^p \in \der L$.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop}{\label{NonSDiag}}  Let be $V$ a finite dimension vector space over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p>0$ and $f \in \ennd V$ non-singular with order $r$ coprime to $p$. Then $f$ is diagonalizable.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Let $A$ be the matrix of the endomorphism $f$ in Jordan normal form and write $A=S+N$ such that $S$ is diagonalizable, $N$ is nilpotent and $S,N$ commute. Denote by $M_{ij}$ the element of matrix $M$ of $i^{th}$ line and $j^{th}$ column. Follow that \begin{itemize}
\item  If  $S_{ii} = \lambda_i$ then $S^k_{ii}=\lambda_i^k,$ for  all $k>0$;
\item $N^k_{i(i+j)}=0,$ for all $0 \leq j < k$  and all $k>0$.
\end{itemize}
As the order of $A$ is $r$ we have $A^r=Id$. Then 
$$Id=A^r=(S+N)^r=S^r+\binom{r}{1} S^{r-1}N+ \binom{r}{2}s^{r-2}N^2+\cdots + \binom{r}{r-1}SN^{r-1}+N^r.$$ So $\binom{r}{1} S^{r-1}N=r(s^{r-1}n)=0$. But $r$ and the eigenvalues of $S^{r-1}$ are nonzero, this implies $S=0$. Then $f$ is diagonalizable.\end{proof}

Let $L$ be a Lie algebra over the field $\F$ such that $L$ has a non-singular derivation $d$. Let $r$ be the order of $d$ such that $r=sp^t$, with $\gcd (s,p)=1$. Then $d^{p^t}$ is a derivation whose order is prime to $p$ and, by Proposition \ref{NonSDiag}, it is diagonalizable. So if $L$ is a Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $\F$ of characteristic $p>0$ with non-singular derivation then $L$ has a diagonalizable derivation $d$ without eigenvalue 0.
 
 \begin{prop}{\label{Shalevlem}} Let $L$ be a finite-dimensional Lie algebra in characteristic $p>0$ which admits a non-singular derivation $d$ whose order $n$ is coprime to $p$. Suppose $L$ is not nilpotent. Then there exist $\lambda \in \bar{\F}_p$ such that $(\lambda+ \delta)^n=1$ for all $\delta \in \F_p$.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof} Let $R=\{\alpha \in \bar{\F}_p  \mid \alpha^n=1\}$. If $R$ is not contained in base field of $L$ then we consider $d$ for the extension $L \otimes \bar{\F}$, such that $F \subset \bar{\F}$. By Proposition \ref{NonSDiag}, $d$ is diagonalizable. Let $L=L_{\lambda1} \dotplus \cdots \dotplus L_{\lambda_r}$ the decomposition of $L$ to eigenspaces of $d$. The set $S=\bigcup \ad{}{L_{\lambda_j}}$ is weakly closed with $\gamma(\ad{}{a},\ad{}{b})=-1$ for all $a \in L_{\lambda_i}, b \in L_{\lambda_j}$. If each $\ad{}{a}$ is nilpotent then $L$ is nilpotent by Proposition \ref{1.02}. As $L$ is non-nilpotent by hypothesis then there is $a \in L_{\lambda_j}$ and $b \in L_{\lambda_i}$ such that $(\ad{}{a})^n(b) \neq 0$, $1 \leq n \leq p$. However this implies , $(\lambda_i+ \delta \lambda_j)$ are eigenvalues of $d$ for  $1 \leq r \leq p$. Set $\lambda=\lambda_i \lambda_j^{-1}$. Then $(\lambda + \delta)^n =1$ for all $\delta \in \F_p$.
\end{proof}  

Usying the same notation of proof of Proposition \ref{Shalevlem} write $x^n-1=\prod_{\alpha \in R}(x - \alpha)$. Hence $\prod_{\delta \in \F_p}(x-\lambda - \delta)$ divides $x^n-1$. But $$\prod_{\delta \in \F_p}(x-\lambda - \delta)=(x-\lambda)^p-(x-\lambda)=x^p-x-c,$$ where $c=\lambda^p-\lambda$. Let $g(x)=x^p-x-c$. Then $g(x)$ divides $x^n-1$, which implies that $x^n$ is congruent to 1 modulo $g(x)$. In this case, Lemma 2.4 of \cite{Shalev} shows that $n \geq p^2-1$. Now we can prove the theorem.

\begin{teo} Let $L$ be a finite dimensional Lie algebra in characteristic $p>0$ which admits non-singular derivation of order $n$. Write $n=p^sm$ where $m$ is coprime to $p$. Suppose $m<p^2-1$. Then $L$ is nilpotent.   
\end{teo}

\begin{proof} The derivation $d^{p^s}$ has order $m$. Suppose that $L$ is not nilpotent. Then by the comment above we have $m \geq p^2-1$.
\end{proof}

  Mattarei in \cite{Mattarei} presented an example of non-nilpotent solvable modular Lie algebra. 
  
\begin{ex}{\label{mattareiex}} Let $\alpha, \beta \in \bar{\F}_p$ with $\alpha \beta^{-1} \notin \F_p $. Let $M$ be a $p$-dimensional vector space over $\bar{\F}_p$ with basis $e_1, \cdots, e_p$, and let $E,F$ be the linear transformations of $M$ defined by $E(e_i)=e_{i+1}$(indices modulo $p$), and $F(e_i)=(\alpha +i \beta)e_i$. The transformations $E$ and $F$ span a two-dimensional solvable Lie algebra, which has $M$ as a left module. Let $L$ be the semidirect sum of $\lbrace E \rbrace$ and $M$ with respect to this action. Then $F$ acts on $L$ as a non-singular derivation, with eigenvalues $\beta$ on $\lbrace E \rbrace$, and $\alpha + \lambda \beta$ for $\lambda \in \F_p$ on $M$.    
\end{ex}  

 The next result links the orders non-singular derivations of Lie algebras of characteristic $p$ and two polynomials.

\begin{prop} Let $p$ a prime number and let $n$ be a positive integer, prime to o. The following statements are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item there exists a non-nilpotent Lie algebra of characteristic $p$ with a non-singular derivations of order n;
\item there exists an element $\alpha \in \bar{\F_p}$ such that $(\alpha + \lambda)^n=1$ for all $\lambda \in \F_p$
\item there exist an element $c \in \bar{\F^*_p}$ such that $x^p-x-c$ divides $x^n-1$ as elements of the polynomial ring $\bar{\F_p}[x]$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

Mattarei in \cite{Mattarei} defines the set $N_p$ of the possible orders of non-singular derivations of non-nilpotent Lie algebras of characteristic $p$ and determine all elements of $N_p$ which are smaller than $p^3$, for $p>3$.   



 
\section{Derivations and Lie algebra extensions}{\label{extensions}}

\subsection{Lie algebra extensions}
The symbol `$\oplus$' will be used to denote the direct 
sum of algebras,
while  the
direct sum of vector spaces will be denoted by `$\dotplus$'.


An {\em extension} of a Lie algebra  $K$ by a Lie algebra
$I$  is an exact sequence 
\begin{equation}\label{ext}
0 \to I \stackrel{ i}{\to} L \stackrel{ s}{\to} K \to 0
\end{equation}
of Lie algebras.
The Lie algebra $L$ in the middle of the exact sequence contains an
ideal
$\ker s=\mbox{Im}\,i\cong I$ such that $L/I\cong K$. We will write
informally that
`$L$ is an extension of $K$ by $I$'. The extension~\eqref{ext}
{\em splits}
if $L$ has a subalgebra $S$ such that $L=S \dotplus\ker s$. 
The extension~\eqref{ext} is {\em trivial} if there exists an ideal $S$ of $L$
such that $L=S\oplus\ker s$. The extension~\eqref{ext} is central if 
$\ker s$ lies in the center $Z(L)$ of $L$.

Suppose that $K$ and $I$ are Lie algebras and $\psi:K\rightarrow\der I$
is a given Lie algebra homomorphism.
Then we say that  $K$ {\em acts} on $I$ or that $I$ is a {\em $K$-module}.
In this case, the image $\psi(k)(a)$ of $a\in I$ under
$k\in K$ will be written
simply as $[k,a]$.
If $I$ is an ideal of a Lie algebra $K$, then $K$ acts on $I$. If 
$k\in K$, then the image of $k$ under this action will be denoted by $\ad Ik$ or
simply by $\ad {}k$ when the domain of the representation is clear from 
the context. Thus, for $a\in I$ and for
$k\in K$, $\ad Ik(a)=\ad{}k(a)=[k,a]$.  The homomorphism
$K\rightarrow \der I$ that takes $k\mapsto\ad Ik$, 
will be denoted by $\ad I{}$. 

\begin{ex}{\label{adjrepex}} Let $L$ be a Lie algebra with an abelian ideal $I$ and
  set $K=L/I$.
  Define the Lie algebra representation $\ad{I}{}:K \to \der I$
  by $\ad{I}{x+I}(a)=[x,a]$ for
  all $x\in L$ and $a \in I$. This is well defined, since
  $I$ is abelian. Then $I$ is a $K$-module. In this case,
  we say that the action is {\em induced by the
    adjoint representation}.
\end{ex}



Let $K$ be a Lie algebra over a field $\F$
and let $I$ be a vector space over $\F$.
Denote by $\ctwo KI$ the vector space of alternating bilinear maps
$\vartheta: K \times K \to I$.
If $I$ is a $K$-module and
$\vartheta \in \ctwo KI$ has the property that
$$
\vartheta(x,[y,z])+\vartheta(y,[z,x])+\vartheta(z,[x,y])+
[x,\vartheta(y,z)]+[y,\vartheta(z,x)]+[z,\vartheta(x,y)]=0,
$$
for all $ x,\ y,\ z \in K$, then $\vartheta$ is said to be a
{\em cocycle} and the vector space of coclycles is denoted by $\ztwo KI$.
Let $T:K \to I$ be a linear transformation and define, 
$\vartheta_T:K\times K\rightarrow I$ by
$$
\vartheta_T(k,h)=T([k,h])+[h,T(k)]-[k,T(h)]\quad
\mbox{for all}\quad k,\ h \in K.
$$
Then $\vartheta_T\in\ztwo KI$ and such
a cocycle $\vartheta_T$ is said to be
a {\em coboundary}.
The set of coboundaries is denoted by $\btwo KI$. 
The set $\btwo KI$ is a subspace of
$\ztwo KI$, and we set $\htwo KI=\ztwo KI/\btwo KI$ to be
the quotient space. 
The first cohomology group of $K$ and $I$ is defined as
$$\zone KI=\{\nu \in \hom KI \mid \nu([k,h])=[k,\nu(h)]-[h,\nu(k)]
\mbox{ for all } k,\ h \in K\}.
$$


The next result, whose proofs can be found, for instance, 
in \cite[Section~4.2]{Knapp}, links Lie algebra extensions to cohomology.
Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and let $I$ be a $K$-module.
  Let $\vartheta \in \ztwo KI$ and
  define the Lie algebra $K_{\vartheta}=K \dotplus I$ with the product
  \begin{equation}
 [x+a,y+b]=[x,y]+\vartheta(x,y)+[a,y]-[b,x] \mbox{ for all } x,\ y \in K \mbox{ and } a,\ b \in I.
 \end{equation}
 
\begin{prop} \label{prop:cocic}
 The following hold for the Lie algebra $K_\vartheta$:
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item $K_\vartheta$ is a Lie algebra extension of $K$ by $I$;
 \item if $\nu\in\btwo KI$, then
   $K_\vartheta$ is isomorphic to $K_{\vartheta+\nu}$;
 \item  if $\vartheta\in\btwo KI$, then
   $K_\vartheta$ is a split extension of $K$ by $I$.
 \end{enumerate}
 Conversely, let  $L$ be a Lie algebra and $J$ be an abelian ideal of
 $L$. Then there exists $\vartheta \in \ztwo{L/J}J$ such that
 $L \cong (L/J)_\vartheta$. 
\end{prop}

The cocycle $\vartheta$ in last statement   of
Proposition~\ref{prop:cocic} can
be constructed as follows. Let $\pi:L\rightarrow L/I$ denote the
natural projection, and let $\sigma: L/I\rightarrow L$ be
a right inverse of $\pi$; that is,
$\pi\sigma=\mbox{id}_{L/I}$. Then, for $k+I,\ h+I\in L/I$,
set
$$
\vartheta(k+I,h+I)=\sigma([k+I,h+I])-[\sigma(k+I),\sigma(h+I)].
$$
Routine calculation shows that $\vartheta\in\ztwo {L/I}I$ and
that $L\cong L_\vartheta$.

 
\subsection{Compatible pairs and derivations of semidirect sums}

Compatible pairs were introduced in~\cite{Eick} to compute automorphisms
of solvable groups and solvable Lie algebras. We adopt the
concept for derivations of Lie algebras.  
Let $K$ and $I$ be Lie algebras such that $K$ acts on $I$
via the homomorphism $\psi:K\rightarrow\der I$.
We  define the {\em semidirect sum} $K\sdsum_\psi I$
as the vector
space $K\dotplus I$ with the product operation given as
$$
[(k_1,a_1),(k_2,a_2)]=([k_1,k_2],[k_1,a_2]-[k_2,a_1]+[a_1,a_2]).
$$
When the $K$-action on $I$ is clear from the context, then we
usually suppress the homomorphism `$\psi$' from the notation and write
simply $K\sdsum I$. If $L$ is a Lie algebra such that $L$ has
an ideal $I$ and a subalgebra $K$ in such a way that
$L=K\dotplus I$, then $L\cong K\sdsum_\psi I$ where $\psi$
is the restriction of $\ad {}I$ to $K$.
In a semidirect sum $K\sdsum I$, an element $(k,a)\in K\dotplus I$
will usually be written as $k+a$. 


Suppose that $K$ and $I$ are as in the previous paragraph.
The direct sum $\der K\oplus\der I$ of
the derivation Lie algebras is a Lie algebra.
An element $(\alpha,\beta)\in \der K\oplus\der I$ is said to be a
{\em compatible pair} if
\begin{equation}{\label{compeq}}
  \beta ([k,a])=[\alpha(k),a]+[k,\beta(a)] \quad\mbox{for all}\quad
  k \in K,\ a \in I.
\end{equation}
We let $\comp KI$ denote the set of compatible pairs in
$\der K\oplus\der I$.
Using the homomorphism $\psi:K\rightarrow\der I$
associated to the $K$-action on $I$, we can write equation (\ref{compeq}) in another form
as follows. 
Writing $[k,a]$ as $\psi(k)(a)$, we have that
$(\alpha,\beta) \in \comp KI$ if and only if the equation
\begin{equation*}
  \beta \psi(k)= \psi (\alpha(k))+\psi(k)\beta.
\end{equation*}
holds in $\der I$ for all  $k \in K$.
Using commutator, this is equivalent to  
\begin{equation}{\label{compcomu}}
  [\beta,\psi(k)]=\psi (\alpha(k)) \mbox\quad \mbox{for all} \quad k \in K.
\end{equation}
Letting $\ad{}{}:\der I\to \der I$ denote the 
adjoint representation, equation~\eqref{compcomu} can be rewritten
as
$$
\ad{}{\beta}\psi(k)=\psi (\alpha(k))\quad \mbox{for all}\quad k \in K.
$$
Therefore, $(\alpha,\beta) \in\comp KI$
if and only if the following diagram commutes:
$$ \xymatrix{K \ar[d]^{ \alpha} \ar[r]^{\psi} \ar@{}[dr]|{\circlearrowright} &
  {\der I} \ar[d]^{\ad{}{\beta}} \\ K \ar[r]^{\psi} & {\der I}.} $$

A compatible pair $(\alpha,\beta)\in
\der K\oplus\der I$ will usually be written as $\alpha+\beta$.
If $\alpha+\beta\in\der K\oplus\der I$ as above,
then $\alpha+\beta$ can be considered a element of
$\gl{I\oplus K}$ by letting $(\alpha+\beta)(a+k)=
\alpha(a)+\beta(k)$ for all $a\in I$ and $k\in K$.

\begin{prop}{\label{compsdsum}}
  Using the notation above,
  we have that
  $$
  \comp KI=\{\alpha+\beta\in\gl K\oplus\gl I\mid
  \alpha+\beta\in\der{K\sdsum I}\}.
  $$
  In particular $\comp KI$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\der{K\sdsum I}$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof}
%%   First we show that $\comp IK$ is 
%%   a Lie subalgebra of  $\der I\oplus
%%   \der K$.
%%   Suppose that $(\alpha,\beta),\ (\alpha',\beta') \in \comp KI$ and
%% assume that the $K$-action on $I$ is given by the representation
%% $\psi:K \to \der I$ such that $\psi(k)(a)=[a,k]$ for all
%% $k \in K$ and $a \in I$. First we check that
%% $\comp KI$ is a vector subspace using equation (\ref{compcomu}).
%% If $\lambda \in \F$ and $k \in K$ then
%% $$
%% \begin{array}{rcl}
%% [\psi(k),\beta+\lambda \beta'] & = & [\psi(k),\beta]+ \lambda[\psi(k), \beta'] \\
%%  & = & -\psi(k)(\alpha)-\lambda\psi(k)(\alpha') \\
%%   & = & \psi(k)(\alpha+\lambda\alpha').
%% \end{array}
%% $$
%% Hence $(\alpha,\beta)+\lambda(\alpha',\beta') \in \comp KI$.
%%
%%%% Using the definition of compatible pairs, 
%% $$
%% \beta' \psi(k)=\psi(k)\beta'+\psi(\alpha'(k)).
%% $$ 
%% Then
%% $$
%% \begin{array}{rcl}
%% \beta \beta' \psi(k) & = & \beta\psi(k)\beta'+\beta \psi (\alpha'(k)) \\
%% &=& \psi(k)\beta\beta'+\psi (\alpha(k))\beta'+\psi(\alpha'(k)) \beta+ \psi(\alpha'\alpha(k)).
%% \end{array}
%% $$
%% Similarly,
%% $$
%% \beta'\beta \psi(k)=\psi(k)\beta'\beta+\psi (\alpha'(k))\beta+\psi(\alpha(k)) \beta'+ \psi(\alpha\alpha'(k)).
%% $$
%% Therefore
%% $$
%% [\beta,\beta']\psi(k)=\psi(k)(\beta\beta'-\beta'\beta)+\psi((\alpha \alpha' - \alpha' \alpha)(k))=\psi(k)[\beta,\beta']+\psi([\alpha, \alpha'](k)).
%% $$
%% Hence $[(\alpha,\beta),(\alpha',\beta')] \in \comp KI$.


  Suppose that $\alpha+\beta\in\comp KI$ is a compatible pair
  and let $k+a,\ k'+a'\in K\sdsum I$.
  Then 
\begin{multline*}
  (\alpha+\beta)[k+a,k'+a'] =  (\alpha+\beta)
  ([k,k']+([k,a']-[k',a]+[a,a']))\\
  = \alpha([k,k'])+\beta([k,a']-[k',a]+[a,a'])\\
 =[\alpha(k),k']+[k,\alpha(k')]+[\alpha(k),a']-[\alpha(k'),a] \\ 
 +[\beta(a),a']+[k,\beta(a')]-[k',\beta(a)]+[a,\beta(a')].
  \end{multline*}
On the other hand
\begin{multline*}
[(\alpha+\beta)(k+a),k'+a']+[k+a,(\alpha+\beta)(k'+a')]=\\
[\alpha(k),k']+[\alpha(k),a']+[\beta(a),k']+[\beta(a),a']\\+
[k,\alpha(k')]+[k,\beta(a')]+[a,\alpha(k')]+[a,\beta(a')].
\end{multline*}
Thus $\alpha+\beta\in\der{K\sdsum I}$.

Conversely, let
$\alpha+\beta\in \gl{K}\oplus \gl I$ such that
$\alpha+\beta$ is a derivation of $K\sdsum I$. Then
$(\alpha+\beta)|_K=\alpha$ and $(\alpha+\beta)|_I=\beta$, and so
$\alpha\in\der K$ and $\beta\in\der I$. Further, if $k\in K$ and
$a\in I$, then $[k,a]\in I$, and so
$$
\beta([k,a])=(\alpha+\beta)[k,a]=[(\alpha+\beta)(k),a]+
     [k,(\alpha+\beta)(a)]=[\alpha(k),a]+[k,\beta(a)].
     $$
     Thus $\alpha+\beta\in\comp KI$, as required.

     The fact that $\comp KI$ is a Lie subalgebra of $\der{K\sdsum I}$
     follows from the fact that
     $\comp KI$ is the intersection of two Lie algebras; namely,
     $\comp KI=(\gl K\oplus\gl I)\cap\der{K\sdsum I}$.
\end{proof}


Let $K$ and $I$ be vector spaces. Consider the Lie algebra
$\gl K\oplus\gl I$ and define an action of  $\gl K\oplus\gl I$
on the vector space $\hom K{\gl I}$ as follows.
Let $\ad{}{}$ denote the adjoint representation
of $\gl I$. Thus, for $\beta,\ \beta'\in\gl I$ and $\ad{}\beta(\beta')=
[\beta,\beta']$.
For $(\alpha,\beta) \in \gl K
\oplus \gl I$ and for $T \in \hom K{\gl I}$, set
 \begin{equation}{\label{acaocomp}}
 (\alpha,\beta)\cdot T=\ad{}{\beta}T-T\alpha.
 \end{equation}
 Let us show that this in fact defines a Lie algebra
 action.
 First notice that
 $(\alpha,\beta) \cdot T$ is a linear map because
 is linear combination of composition and sums of linear maps.
 Let us check that it preserves Lie brackets.
 Let $(\alpha,\beta),\ (\alpha',\beta')
 \in \gl K \oplus \gl I$
 and $k \in K$. By definition
 $$
 (\alpha',\beta')\cdot T=\ad{}{\beta'}T-T\alpha'.
 $$
 So
 $$(\alpha,\beta)\cdot((\alpha',\beta')\cdot T)=\ad{}{\beta}\ad{}{\beta'}T-\ad{}{\beta'}T\alpha-\ad{}{\beta}T \alpha'+T\alpha'\alpha.$$
 In the same way, 
$$(\alpha',\beta')\cdot((\alpha,\beta)\cdot T)=\ad{}{\beta'}\ad{}{\beta}T-\ad{}{\beta}T\alpha'-\ad{}{\beta'}T \alpha+T\alpha\alpha'.$$
Hence, $$\begin{array}{rcl}
(\alpha,\beta)\cdot((\alpha',\beta')\cdot T)-(\alpha',\beta')\cdot((\alpha,\beta)\cdot T) & = &\ad{}{\beta}\ad{}{\beta'}T-\ad{}{\beta'}\ad{}{\beta}T+T\alpha\alpha'-T\alpha'\alpha \\ 
&=& [\ad{}{\beta},\ad{}{\beta'}]T+T[\alpha,\alpha'].
\end{array}$$
Therefore, $$[(\alpha,\beta),(\alpha',\beta')]\cdot T= ([\alpha,\alpha'],[\beta,\beta'])\cdot T.$$

Now, if $K$ is a Lie algebra and $I$ is a $K$-module, then
there is a corresponding homomorphism
$\psi\in\hom K{\der I}$. Now suppose that $\alpha+\beta\in \gl K\oplus
\gl I$ such that $\alpha+\beta\in\der K\oplus\der I$. 
Then, for $k \in K$, we have $\ad{}{\beta}T(k)+T\alpha(k)$ is a derivation of $I$ since $\ad{}{\beta}T(k),\ T\alpha(k) \in\der I$.

If $X$ is a subalgebra of $\der K\oplus\der I$, then 
the annihilator $\ann K\psi$ of $\psi$ in $X$ is defined as
$$
\ann X\psi=\{(\alpha,\beta)\in X\mid
(\alpha,\beta)\cdot \psi=0\}.
$$
Computing the annihilator of $\psi$ in $\der K\oplus \der I$
explicitly, we obtain
\begin{multline*}
\ann{\der K\oplus \der I}\psi  =  \{(\alpha,\beta) \in \der K\oplus \der I \mid (\alpha,\beta)\cdot \psi=0 \} \\
= \{(\alpha,\beta) \in \der K\oplus \der I \mid  \ad{}{\beta}\psi-\psi\alpha=0 \} 
= \comp KI.
\end{multline*}
The last equality follows from~\eqref{compcomu}.
Hence we have  proved the following  proposition.

\begin{prop} Let $K$ and $I$ be Lie algebras such that $I$
  is also a $K$-module via 
  the representation
  $\psi\in\hom K{\der I}$. Then
  $\comp KI=\ann{\der K\oplus\der I} \psi$, where the
  action of $\der K\oplus \der I$ on  $\hom K{\der I}$
  is given by~\eqref{acaocomp}.
\end{prop}


\subsection{Derivations of $K_\vartheta$}
 
 In this section we present a method to describe the derivations of extension $K_\vartheta$ presented in Proposition \ref{prop:cocic}  from derivations of Lie algebra $K$. By an adaptation of the process used by Eick in \cite{Eick}, we set conditions for a derivation in $K$ can be lifted to a derivation of $K_\vartheta$. 
  It is first necessary define an action of $\gl K \oplus \gl I$ on vector space of alternating bilinear maps.
  
   Let $K$ and $I$ be vector spaces. Let $(\alpha,\beta)$ be an element of Lie algebra $\gl K \oplus \gl I$ and $\vartheta \in \ctwo K I$, define an action $\gl K \oplus \gl I$ on $\vartheta \in \ctwo K I$ by
 \begin{equation}{\label{1}}
 (\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta(h,k)=\beta(\vartheta(h,k))-\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)-\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)), \quad \mbox{ for all } h,k \in K.
 \end{equation}
 
 If $(\alpha',\beta') \in \gl K \oplus \gl I$ then by our definition 
  \begin{multline*}
 (\alpha,\beta)(\alpha',\beta')\cdot \vartheta(h,k)=\beta\beta'\vartheta(h,k))-\beta'\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)-\beta'\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)) \\
 -\beta\vartheta(\alpha'(h),k))+\vartheta(\alpha'\alpha(k),h)-\vartheta(\alpha'(k),\alpha(h))\\
 \beta\vartheta(h,\alpha'(k))-\vartheta(\alpha(k),\alpha'(h))-\vartheta(k,\alpha'\alpha(h)).
 \end{multline*}
 Follow that
$$
 [(\alpha,\beta),(\alpha',\beta')]\cdot \vartheta(h,k)=[\beta,\beta']\vartheta(h,k))-\vartheta([\alpha',\alpha](k),h)-\vartheta(k,[\alpha',\alpha](h)).
$$ Therefore, the action presented in (\ref{1}) is well defined. 

Our goal now is to study the action of compatible pairs $\comp K I$ on subspaces $\ztwo K I$ and $\btwo K I$ of $\ctwo K I$. For this, consider that $K$ is a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Then for all $k,h,l \in K$, $(\alpha,\beta) \in \comp K I$ and $\vartheta \in Z^2(K,I)$ we have 
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
(\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta(k,[h,l])& = &\beta(\vartheta(k,[h,l]))-\vartheta(\alpha(k),[h,l])-\vartheta(k,\alpha([h,l]))\\ 
& = & \beta(\vartheta(k,[h,l]))-\vartheta(\alpha(k),[h,l])-\vartheta(k,[\alpha(h),l])-\vartheta(k,[h,\alpha(l)]).
\end{array}$$ If $$X=(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta(k,[h,l])+(\alpha,\beta) \cdot \vartheta(h,[l,k])+(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta(l,[k,h]),$$ then
\begin{multline*} X=\beta(\vartheta(k,[h,l]))+\beta(\vartheta(h,[l,k]))+\beta(\vartheta(l,[k,h])) \\
 -\vartheta(\alpha(k),[h,l])-\vartheta(\alpha(h),[l,k])-\vartheta(\alpha(l),[k,h]) \\
-\vartheta(k,[\alpha(h),l])-\vartheta(h,[\alpha(l),k])-\vartheta(l,[\alpha(k),h]) \\
-\vartheta(k,[h,\alpha(l)])-\vartheta(h,[l,\alpha(k)])-\vartheta(l,[k,\alpha(h)]).\\
\end{multline*}

Using cocycle definition 
\begin{multline*}
X=-\beta([k,\vartheta(h,l)])-\beta([h,\vartheta(l,k)])-\beta([l,\vartheta(k,h)])\\
+[\alpha(k),\vartheta(h,l)]+[\alpha(h),\vartheta(l,k)]+[\alpha(l),\vartheta(k,h)]\\
+[k,\vartheta(\alpha(h),l)]+[h,\vartheta(\alpha(l),k)]+[l,\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)]\\
+[k,\vartheta(h,\alpha(l))]+[h,\vartheta(l,\alpha(k))]+[l,\vartheta(k,\alpha(h))].\\
\end{multline*}
$(\alpha,\beta)$ is a compatible pair then we can replace in $X$ the equalities  

$$\beta([k,\vartheta(h,l)]) = [\alpha(k),\vartheta(h,l)]+ [k,\beta(\vartheta(h,l))];$$
$$\beta([h,\vartheta(l,k)]) = [\alpha(h),\vartheta(l,k)]+ [h,\beta(\vartheta(l,k))];$$
$$\beta([l,\vartheta(k,h)]) = [\alpha(l),\vartheta(k,h)]+ [l,\beta(\vartheta(k,h))];$$
Hence
\begin{multline*}
X=-[k,\beta(\vartheta(h,l))]-[h,\beta(\vartheta(l,k))]-[l,\beta(\vartheta(k,h))]\\
+[k,\vartheta(\alpha(h),l)]+[h,\vartheta(\alpha(l),k)]+[l,\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)]\\
+[k,\vartheta(h,\alpha(l))]+[h,\vartheta(l,\alpha(k))]+[l,\vartheta(k,\alpha(h))].\\
\end{multline*} Again, by action definition we obtain
$$X=-[k,(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta(h,l)]-[h,(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta(l,k)]-[l,(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta(k,h)].$$
 So $(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta \in Z^2(K,I)$.
 
 Now suppose that $\vartheta \in \btwo K I$. Then there is a linear map $T:K \to I$ such that
 \begin{equation}
 {\label{1.4}} \vartheta(k,h)= T([k,h])+[h,T(k)]-[k,T(h)].
 \end{equation}
 
Let $Y=(\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta(k,h)$. By (\ref{1.4}) we have 
 $$
 Y=(\alpha,\beta)\cdot( T([k,h])+[h,T(k)]-[k,T(h)]).
$$
 
  Using action definition we have
 \begin{multline*}
Y  =  \beta T([k,h])+\beta([h,T(k)])- \beta([k,T(h)]) \\
    -T([\alpha(h),k])-[\alpha(h),T(k)]+[\alpha(k),T(h)]\\
    -T([k,\alpha(h)])-[h,T\alpha(k)]+[k,T \alpha (h)].\\
\end{multline*}
 We can use that $(\alpha,\beta)$ is a compatible pair in last equation
\begin{multline*}
Y=\beta T([k,h])+[\alpha(h),T(k)]+[h,\beta T (k)]-[\alpha(k),T(h)]- [k, \beta T (h)]\\
-T([\alpha(k),h])-[\alpha(h),T(k)]+[\alpha(k),T(h)]\\
    -T([k,\alpha(h)])-[h,T\alpha(k)]+[k,T \alpha (h)]\\
=\beta T([k,h])+[h,\beta T (k)]- [k, \beta T (h)]\\
-T([\alpha(k),h]) -T([k,\alpha(h)])-[h,T\alpha(k)]+[k,T \alpha (h)]\\
\end{multline*}  
 Hence, $$Y=(\beta T-T \alpha)([k,h])-[h,(\beta T-T \alpha)(k)]+[k,(\beta T-T \alpha)(h)].$$
 If $U=\beta T-T \alpha:K \to I$ then $$(\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta(k,h)=U([k,h])-[h,U(h)]-[k,U(h)].$$ Therefore,  $(\alpha,\beta)\cdot\vartheta \in \btwo K I$. We just proof
 
  
\begin{prop}{\label{inva}} Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Consider the action of \newline $\comp K I$ on $C^2(K,I)$ defined in ({\ref{1}}). Then the vector spaces $Z^2(K,I)$ and $\btwo K I$ are invariants by this action.
\end{prop}


 This result allow us to define an action of $\comp K I$ on $H^2(K,I)$: let $\vartheta \in Z^2(K,I)$ and $(\alpha, \beta) \in \comp K I$. Define the action \begin{equation}{\label{acaoind}}
  (\alpha,\beta)\cdot (\vartheta +\btwo K I)=((\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta)+\btwo K I.
 \end{equation}
 This is well defined by Proposition \ref{inva}.
 
  \begin{df}  Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Let $\vartheta \in Z^2(K,I)$ and consider the action of $\comp K I$ on $H^2(K,I)$ defined in (\ref{acaoind}). Define the set of induced pairs of $\comp K I$ by  $$Indu(K,I,\vartheta)=Ann_{\comp K I}(\vartheta+\btwo K I).$$
 \end{df}

Now we have the tools needed to describe the Lie algebra $\der {K_\vartheta}$ from the Lie algebra $\der K $. We will define a homomorphism $\phi : \der {  K_\vartheta} \to \der K$, which kernel is known and the image coincides with the induced pairs defined above. So, using the first theorem of isomorphisms for Lie algebras we have $\der {  K_\vartheta}$ is isomorphic to $\ker \phi \oplus \im \phi$ but these subspaces correspond to structures: $\ker \phi \cong \sf Z^1 (K,I)$ and $\im \phi \cong \sf Indu (K,I, \vartheta)$. One application of this type of construction is  use known information of algebra $\der K$ to obtain information about algebra $\der K_\vartheta$ as the existence of non-singular derivations. Therefore, this method will allow us to study some properties of Lie algebras extensions by cocycles. First we define $\phi$.


Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Let $\vartheta \in \htwo KI$ and $d \in \der K_{\vartheta}$. Suppose  that $I$, as ideal of $K_\vartheta$, it is invariant by derivation $d$. Set $P_K:K_\vartheta\to K$ and $P_I:K_\vartheta\to I$ to be the natural projections of $K_\vartheta$ on $K$ and $K_\vartheta$ on $I$ then define the maps
\begin{itemize}{\label{w}}
\item $\alpha:K \to K$ by $\alpha(k)=P_K d(k)$, for all $k \in K$;
\item $\beta:I \to I$ by $\beta(a)=d(a),$ for all $a \in I$;
\item $\varphi:K \to I$ by $\varphi(k)=P_I d(k),$ for all $k \in K$.
\end{itemize} For each $x+a \in K_\vartheta$ we have   
\begin{equation}{\label{3}}
d(x+a)=\alpha(x)+\varphi(x)+\beta(a) \mbox{ for all } a \in I \mbox{ and } x \in K.
\end{equation}   
   
 We can see that $\beta$ is a derivation of $I$ because it is restriction of $d$ to $I$. To see that $\alpha \in \der K$ let $x,y \in K$. Then by product definition on $K_\vartheta$  
 $$d([x,y]_\vartheta)=d([x,y]_K+\vartheta(x,y)).$$ By decomposition showed in (\ref{3}) $$d([x,y]_\vartheta)=\alpha([x,y]_K)+\varphi([x,y]_K)+\beta(\vartheta(x,y)).$$ 
 
 We can calculate\begin{equation}\label{1.5}
 [d(x),y]_\vartheta+[x,d(y)]_\vartheta=[\alpha(x)+\varphi(x),y]+[x,\alpha(y)+\varphi(y)], 
 \end{equation} and use product definition of $K_\vartheta$ to get \begin{multline}{\label{1.6}}
 [d(x),y]_\vartheta+[x,d(y)]_\vartheta=[\alpha(x),y]_K+[x,\alpha(y)]_K+ \vartheta(\alpha(x),y) \\ +\vartheta(y,\alpha(x))+ [\varphi(x),\alpha(y)]-[\varphi(y),\alpha(x)].
\end{multline}
 
Comparing the components of $K$ in (\ref{1.5}) and (\ref{1.6}) we have $$\alpha([x,y]_K)=[\alpha(x),y]_K+[x,\alpha(y)]_K,$$ and $\alpha \in \der K$. 


Now it's possible define our homomorphism $\phi$. Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Let $\vartheta \in H^2(K,I)$ and suppose  that $I$, as ideal of $K_\vartheta$, it is invariant by derivations. For all $x+a \in  K_{\vartheta}$ and $ d \in \der K_{\vartheta}$  write $d(x+a)=\alpha(x)+\beta(a)+\varphi(x)$ with $\alpha \in der K$ and $\beta \in \der I$. Then define $\phi:Der(K_\vartheta) \to Der(K)\oplus Der(I)$ by \begin{equation}{\label{defphi2}}
\phi(d)=(\alpha,\beta).
\end{equation}
 
The following will check that $\phi$ is a Lie algebra morphism. Let $d,d' \in Der(K_\vartheta)$ and $x \in K  a \in I$ such that  
$$ \begin{array}{rcl}
d(x+a) & = & \alpha(x)+ \varphi(x)+\beta(a) \\
d'(x+a) & = & \alpha'(x)+ \varphi'(x)+\beta'.(x) ,
\end{array}$$ Then
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
 dd'(x)   & = & d(\alpha'(x)+\varphi'(x)) \\
           & = & \alpha \alpha'(x)+\varphi(\alpha'(x))+\beta'(\varphi'(x)). \\
\end{array}$$ Hence, $P_K dd'(x)=\alpha \alpha'(x).$ Analogously, $P_K d'd(x)=\alpha' \alpha(x).$ So $P_K([d,d'])=[\alpha,\alpha']$. As $\beta$ and $\beta'$ are defined by restriction of $d$ and $d'$ to $I$, respectively, then $P_I([d,d'])=[\beta,\beta']$. Therefore,
$$ \phi([d,d'])=([\alpha,\alpha'],[\beta, \beta'])=[(\alpha,\beta),(\alpha',\beta')]=[\phi(d),\phi(d')].$$

The next result presents the first connection between compatible pairs and the homomorphism $\phi$. 

\begin{teo}{\label{comp<im}} Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Let $\vartheta \in H^2(K,I)$ and suppose  that $I$, as ideal of $K_\vartheta$, it is invariant by derivations. Let $\phi: Der(K_\vartheta) \to Der(K)\oplus Der(I)$ given by $\phi(d)=(\alpha,\beta)$, defined in {\ref{defphi2}}. Then $Im(\phi)\leq \comp K I.$
\end{teo}
\begin{proof} Let $(\alpha,\beta) \in Im(\phi)$. Then there is $d \in Der(K_\vartheta)$ such that $\phi(d)=(\alpha,\beta)$. If $k \in K$ and $a \in I$ then 
$$\begin{array}{rclc}
\beta([k,a]_\vartheta)  &= &  d([k,a]_\vartheta) & [k,a] \in I\\
&&& \\
&= &  [d(k),a]_\vartheta+[k,d(a)]_\vartheta & d \in \der {K_\vartheta}\\
&&& \\
&= &  [\alpha(k)+\varphi(k),a]_\vartheta+[k,\beta(a)]_\vartheta & \\
&&& \\
&= &  [\alpha(k),a]_\vartheta+[k,\beta(a)]_\vartheta & \mbox{ because $I$ is abelian }\\
\end{array}$$

\end{proof}



 \begin{teo}{\label{DerExt}} Let $K$ be a Lie algebra and $I$ a $K$-module. Let $\vartheta \in \htwo KI$ and suppose  that $I$, as ideal of $K_\vartheta$, it is invariant by derivations. Let $\phi:\der {K_\vartheta} \to \der K \oplus \der I$ given by $\phi(d)=(\alpha,\beta)$. Then:
 
 \begin{enumerate}
 \item $\im \phi= \sf Indu (K,I,\vartheta)$
  \item $\ker \phi \cong \sf Z^1 (K,I)$
  \end{enumerate}
\end{teo}
\begin{proof} 1) Let $(\alpha,\beta) \in \sf Indu(K,I,\vartheta)$. By definition  $$(\alpha,\beta)\cdot \vartheta=0  \mbox{ mod }  \btwo K I.$$ Then there is a linear map $T:K \to I$ such that for all $k,h \in K$ we have
 \begin{equation}{\label{2}}
  \vartheta(\alpha(k),h)+\vartheta(k,\alpha(h))+[k,T(h)]-[h,T(k)]=\beta(\vartheta(k,h))+T([k,h]).
\end{equation}

 Let $k \in K$, $a \in I$ and define the linear map $(\alpha,\beta)^*:K_\vartheta  \to  K_\vartheta$ by $$(\alpha,\beta)^*(k+a)=\alpha(k)+\beta(a)+T(k).$$
  Let's check that $(\alpha,\beta)^*$ is a derivation of $K_\vartheta$. Let $k+a,h+b \in K_\vartheta$. If  
  $$X= (\alpha,\beta)^*([k+a,h+b]_\vartheta)$$
   then
 $$\begin{array}{rcl}
X & = & (\alpha,\beta)^*([k,h]_K+\vartheta(k,h)+[k,b]-[h,a])\\
& = & \alpha([k,h]_K)+\beta(\vartheta(k,h))++\beta([k,b])-\beta([h,a])+ T([k,h]_K).\\
\end{array}$$
Now, let $$Y=[(\alpha+\beta)^*(k+a),h+b]_\vartheta+[k+a,(\alpha+\beta)^*(h+b)]_\vartheta. $$

We have
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
 [(\alpha+\beta)^*(k+a),h+b]_\vartheta& = & [\alpha(k)+\beta(a)+T(k),h+b]_\vartheta\\
 & = & [\alpha(k),h]_K+\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)+[\alpha(k),b]-[h,\beta(a)+T(k)] \\
 \end{array}$$ and
$$\begin{array}{rcl}
[k+a,(\alpha+\beta)^*(h+b)]_\vartheta & = & [k+a,\alpha(h)+\beta(b)+T(h)]\\
 & = & [k,\alpha(h)]_K+\vartheta(k,\alpha(h))+[k,\beta(b)+T(h)]-[\alpha(h),a]\\
 \end{array}$$ then
 \begin{multline*}
 Y=\alpha([k,h]_K)+ \vartheta(\alpha(k),h)+\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)) \\
+[\alpha(k),b] -[h,\beta(a)]- [h,T(k)]+[k,\beta(b)] +[k,T(h)]-[\alpha(h),a] .
 \end{multline*}

By compatible pair definition we get 
\begin{multline*}
Y=\alpha([k,h]_K)+ \vartheta(\alpha(k),h)+\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)) 
+\beta([k,b])-\beta([h,a])-[h,T(k)]+[k,T(h)].
\end{multline*}

By equation ({\ref{2}}) 
$$Y=\alpha([k,h]_K)+\beta(\vartheta(h,k))+T([k,h])+\beta([k,b])-\beta([h,a]).$$ 

As $X=Y$ then $(\alpha,\beta)^*$ is a derivation.

 Besides, observe that $P_K(\alpha,\beta)^*=\alpha$ and $P_I(\alpha,\beta)^*=\beta$. Hence $\phi((\alpha+\beta)^*)=\alpha+\beta$ , that is, $\sf Indu(K,I,\vartheta) \subseteq \im \phi$. 
 
 Now, suppose that $(\alpha+\beta) \in \im \phi$. Then there is $d \in \der {K_\vartheta}$ such that $$\phi(d)=(\alpha+\beta).$$ By Theorem \ref{comp<im} we have $\im \phi \subseteq \comp K I$. Then it is enough show that there is a linear map $T:K \to I$ such that the equation (\ref{2}) is satisfied.
 
  For each $k+a \in K_\vartheta$ we can use the decomposition defined in ({\ref{3}}) to write  $$d(k+a)=\alpha(k)+\varphi(k)+\beta(a).$$ By product definition in $K_\vartheta$ we get    
 $$\begin{array}{rcl}
 [d(k+a),h+b]_\vartheta & = &[\alpha(k)+\varphi(k)+\beta(a),h+b]_\vartheta\\
 & = &  [\alpha(k),h]_K+\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)+\beta(a)]+[\alpha(k),b]-[h,\varphi(k)\\
 \end{array}$$
 
 $$\begin{array}{rcl}
 [k+a,d(h+b)]_\vartheta& = &[k+a,\alpha(h)+\varphi(h)+\beta(b)]_\vartheta\\
 & = & [k,\alpha(h)]_K+\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)]+[k,\varphi(h)+\beta(b)]-[\alpha(h),a \\
 \end{array}$$
 
 $$\begin{array}{rcl}
d([k+a,h+b]_\vartheta) & = & d([k,h]_K+\vartheta(k,h)+[k,b]-[h,a])\\
 & = &  \alpha([k,h]_K)+\beta(\vartheta(k,h))+\beta([k,b])-\beta([h,a])+\varphi_d([k,h])\\
 \end{array}$$
 
 As $d$ is a derivation then we have equality  $$d[k+a,h+b]=[d(k)+a,h+b]+[k+a,d(h)+b].$$
  So, 
  $$ \beta(\vartheta(k,h))+\varphi([k,h])
=\vartheta(\alpha(k),h)+[k,\varphi(h)]-[h,\varphi(k)]+\vartheta(k,\alpha(h)). 
 $$
  Therefore $T=\varphi$ satisfies the equation (\ref{2}) e $\im \phi \subseteq \sf Indu(K,I,\vartheta).$
 \vspace{0,5cm}  

 2) Let $d \in \ker \phi$. The decomposition showed in (\ref{3}) provide us $$d(k)=\varphi(k),k \in K.$$ Let $k,h \in K$. By derivation definition \begin{equation}{\label{4}}
 d([k,h]_\vartheta)=[d(k),h]_\vartheta+[k,d(h)]_\vartheta.
\end{equation}
 We can use product definition in $K_\vartheta$ to write 
  $$d([k,h]_\vartheta)=d([k,h]_K+\vartheta(k,h)=\varphi([k,h]_K).$$
 By other hand,  $$[d(k),h]_\vartheta+[k,d(h)]_\vartheta=[k,\varphi(h)]_\vartheta-[h,\varphi(k)]_\vartheta=[k,\varphi(h)]-[h,\varphi(k)].$$
  
 Then (\ref{4}) it is equal to $$\varphi([k,h]_K)=[k,\varphi(k)]-[h, \varphi(k)],$$
   and $\varphi \in  \sf Z^1(K,I)$. Now define $\sigma: \ker \phi \to \sf Z^1(K,I),+)$ by $\sigma(d)=\varphi_d$ such that $\varphi_d(k)=d(k)$. Then $\sigma( \ker \phi ) \subseteq \sf Z^1(K,I)$. 
  
  Let $d,d' \in \ker \phi$. Then $$\sigma(d+d')(k)=\varphi_{d+d'}(k)=(d+d')(k)=d(k)+d'(k)=\varphi(k)+\varphi'(k)=(\sigma(d)+\sigma(d'))(k).$$  So $\sigma$ it is group homomorphism.
 
 If $d,d' \in \ker \phi$ such that $\sigma(d)=\sigma(d')$ then $\varphi_d(k)=\varphi_{d'}(k),$ for all $k \in K$ and $d=d'$. Let $T \in \sf Z^1(K,I)$ and define $d:K_\vartheta \to K_\vartheta$ by $$d(x+a)=T(x), x \in K, a \in I.$$ $d$ is a derivation because 
$$ d([k+a,h+b]_\vartheta)=d([k,b]_K+\vartheta(k,h)+[k,b]-[h,a]) 
 =T([k,h]_K)$$ and 
 \begin{multline*}
 [d(k+a),h+b]_\vartheta+[k+a,d(h+b)]_\vartheta=[T(k),h+b]_\vartheta+[k+a,T(h)]_\vartheta \\
 =[k,T(h)]-[h,T(k)].
 \end{multline*}
 It follows that $\sigma(d)=T$. Therefore, $\sigma$ is isomorphism
\end{proof}
 
 \subsection{Compatible pairs and Jacobson Theorem}{\label{secJacobson}} 
 
In this section we show some examples of the use of compatible pairs.

 \begin{ex}{\label{0.7}} Let $K$ and $I$ be finite dimensional Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field $\F$. Suppose that $K$ act on $I$ by representation $\psi:K \to Der(I)$. Let $D \subseteq \comp K I $ be a subalgebra. By Proposition \ref{compsdsum}, $D \subseteq \der L $. If $D$ is nilpotent then $L$ has a decomposition in generalized eigenspaces of $D$. This decomposition induces decompositions in $K$ and $I$, because as subspaces of $L$ they are invariants by $D$. Hence, $$L=K_{\lambda_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus K_{\lambda_r} \oplus I_{\mu_1}\cdots\oplus I_{\mu_s}.$$ In particular, we have $[K_{\lambda_i},I_{\mu_j}]\subseteq I_{\lambda_i+\mu_j}$ if $\lambda_i+\mu_j$ is eigenvalue of $D$ in $I$. Otherwise $[K_{\lambda_i},I_{\mu_j}]=0$.
\end{ex} 
From this example we can state a result:

\begin{prop} \label{0.6} Let $K$ and $I$ be finite dimensional Lie algebras over an algebraically closed field $\F$. Suppose that $K$ act on $I$ by representation $\psi:K \to Der(I)$. Let $D \subseteq \comp K I $ be a subalgebra.  Suppose that 0 is not generalized eigenvalue of $D$. Then if either characteristic of $\F$ is zero or either characteristic of $\F$ is $p$ and $D$ has at most $p-1$ generalized eigenvalues the   $\psi(K)$ is nilpotent.
\end{prop}

\begin{proof}Let $L=K_{\lambda_1} \oplus \cdots \oplus K_{\lambda_r} \oplus I_{\mu_1}\cdots\oplus I_{\mu_s}$ the eigenspace decomposition present in Example \ref{0.7}. Suppose that 0 is not generalized eigenvalue of $D$. Let $E_K= \{ \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_r \}$ and $E_I=\{\mu_1, \cdots, \mu_s \}$ be generalized eigenvalue  of $D$ in $K$ and $I$, respectively. Let $k \in K_{\alpha_j}, a \in I_{\mu_i}$ then
 
 $$\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ccl}
\psi^n(k)(a) \in I_{\mu_i+n\lambda_j} & if & \mu_i+n\lambda_j \in E_I \\ 
\psi^n(k)(a) =0  & if & \mu_i+n\lambda_j \notin E_I \\ 
\end{array} \right.$$
\begin{itemize}
\item If characteristic of $\F$ is zero then the linear functions $\mu_i+ \lambda_j, \mu_i+2 \lambda_j, \cdots, \mu_i+n \lambda_j \cdots$ are all distinct because $\lambda_j \neq 0$, so $\mu_i+n \lambda_j \notin E_I$ for some $n$ and $\psi(k)^n=0 $.
\item  If $char(\F)=p$ and $s < p$ the set $\{\mu_i+ \lambda_j, \mu_i+2 \lambda_j, \cdots, \mu_i+(p-1)\lambda_j,\mu_i\}$ has $p$ distinct elements and $E_I$ has at most $p-1$, then $\psi^n(k)=0$ for some $ n$ with $1 \leq n \leq p$.
\end{itemize} 
 In both cases  $\psi(k)$ is nilpotent for all $k \in K_{\lambda_j}$, $1 \leq j \leq r$. Let $S= \bigcup \psi(K_{\lambda_j})$. $S$ is a weakly closed set such that each element is associative nilpotent then $\psi(K)$ is nilpotent.
\end{proof}

  For our next example we need some result about traces of matrices.
 
\begin{prop}{\label{0.9}} Let $\F$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Suppose that $A \in  M(n, \F)$ with n<p or p=0. Then $A$ is nilpotent if, and only if, the trace of matrices $A^r$ is zero, for $1 \leq r \leq n$.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} Let $\bar{\F}$ the algebraic closure of $F$ e consider $A$ in its Jordan normal form. This can be done because Jordan normal form is obtained from $A$ by conjugation of matrices over $\F$. But since trace and nilpotency of matrices are invariants by conjugation our results still valid for $A$. We will use that a matrix is nilpotent if, and only if, zero is its only eigenvalue.

$A$ can be seen as a diagonal block matrix where each block is formed by grouping the blocks associated to same eigenvalue. Denote by $A_j$ the block associated to eigenvalue $\lambda_t \in \overline{\F}$ and by $n_j$ its order. Let $\lambda_1, \cdots,\lambda_k$ be the non-zero eigenvalues of $A$. Then 
\begin{equation}{\label{1.0}}
tr(A^r)=n_1 \lambda_1^n+\cdots+n_k\lambda_k^n 
\end{equation}

Suppose that $A$ is nilpotent. Then zero is the only eigenvalue of $A$ and by equation ({\ref{1.0}}) we have $tr(A^r)=0$ for $1 \leq r \leq n$.

 Conversely, suppose that $tr(A^r)=0$ for $1 \leq r \leq n$. From equation  ({\ref{1.0}}) we can extract the system 
 
 \begin{equation}{\label{0.8}}
n_1 \lambda_1^r+\cdots+n_k\lambda_k^r=0, \hspace{1cm} 1 \leq r \leq k,
\end{equation} 

in the variables  $n_1, \cdots, n_k$, whose matrix of coefficients is

$$C= \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 & \lambda_2 & \cdots & \lambda_k \\
\lambda_1^2 & \lambda_2^2 & \cdots & \lambda_k^2 \\
\vdots & \vdots &\ddots & \vdots \\
\lambda_1^k & \lambda_2^k & \cdots & \lambda_k^k \\

\end{bmatrix}. $$ 

Denote by $m_i(\lambda)$ the operation that multiplies the line $i$ of a matrix by $\lambda$ and $A^t$ the transposed matrix of $A$. So we can write $$C= m_1(\lambda_1).m_2(\lambda_2) \cdots m_k(\lambda_k).V,$$ where

$$V= \begin{bmatrix}
1 & \lambda_1 & \lambda_1^2 \cdots & \lambda_1^{k-1} \\
1 & \lambda_2 & \lambda_2^2 \cdots & \lambda_2^{k-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots& \vdots  & \vdots \\
1 & \lambda_k & \lambda_k^2 \cdots & \lambda_k^{k-1} \\

\end{bmatrix} $$ is the Vandermonde matrix in the variables $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots, \lambda_k$ whose determinant is $\det V=\prod_{1 \le i<j\le n}(\lambda_j-\lambda_i)$. As $\lambda_i$ are distinct we have that $\det V$ is non-zero. Then the determinant of $C$ is $\lambda_1.\lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_k . \det V$ and $C$ is non-singular. Follow that the system (\ref{0.8}) has only trivial solution. Therefore each $n_j$ is zero. If $p=0$ then zero is the only eigenvector of $A$, but if $p \neq 0$ then $n_j=0$ modulo $p$ doesn't imply $n_j=0$ and its necessary to use that each $n_j<p$ to conclude that zero is the only eigenvalue of $A$.  
\end{proof}


\begin{prop}{\label{1.2}} Let $\F$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Let $A,B,C \in M(n,\F)$ with $p=0$ or $n<p$. If $[A,B]=C+\lambda B$, $\lambda \in \F$ and $[B,C]=0$ then $[A,B^r]=rB^{r-1} C+\lambda r B^r$ for all $r \geq 1$. In particular, if $\lambda \neq 0$ and  $C$ is nilpotent then $B$ is nilpotent.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} We proof this result by induction on $r$. The case $r=1$ follow from hypotheses. Suppose that resultis valid for $(r-1)$. Then, $[A,B^{r-1}]=(r-1)B^{r-2}C+\lambda (r-1)B^{r-1}$. We can rewrite this equation as
 $$\lambda (r-1)B^{r-1} =  AB^{r-1}-B^{r-1}A -(r-1)B^{r-2}C.$$
 Multiplying last equation to right by $B$ we have
 $$\lambda (r-1)B^r =  AB^r-B^{r-1}(AB) -(r-1)B^{r-2}(CB),$$
 From hypotheses we can write $AB=BA+C +\lambda B$ and $CB=BC$. Replacing them above we obtain  
  $$\lambda (r-1)B^r = AB^r-B^rA -B^{r-1}C-\lambda B^r -(r-1)B^{r-1}C.$$
  Therefore,  $$AB^r-B^rA = \lambda r B^r +r B^{r-1}C .$$
  
For the second result suppose $\lambda \neq 0$ and $C$ nilpotent with nilpotency index $m$. Using first part we have
$$B^r = (1/\lambda r)[A,B^r] -(1/\lambda)B^{r-1}C, \mbox{ for all } r \geq 1.$$

Observe that $(B^{r-1}C)^m=(B^{r-1})^m(C)^m=0$, Hence,for all $r \geq 1$ $B^{r-1}C$ is nilpotent and has trace zero by Proposition {\ref{0.9}}. As trace of commutators are always zero then $tr([A,B^r])=0$ for all $r \geq 1$. Follows that $tr(B^r)=0$ for all $r \geq 1$ and again by Proposition {\ref{0.9}} we conclude that $B$ is nilpotent.
\end{proof}

\begin{prop} {\label{adnilp}}Let $L$ be a Lie algebra, $I$ an ideal of $L$ such that $L/I$ is nilpotent and such that $\ad{I}{x}: I \to I$ is nilpotent for all $x \in L$. Then $L$ is nilpotent.
\end{prop}
\begin{proof} As $L/I$ is nilpotent then for each $x \in L$, $(\ad{I}{x+I})^n$ is a nilpotent endomorphism in $\ennd {L/I}$, i.e., there is $n>0$ such that $(\ad{}{x})^n(a) \in I$, for all $x \in L, a \in I$. In the other hand, $\ad{I}{x}$ is nilpotent, so we have a $m$ such that $(\ad{I}{x})^m(\ad{}{x})^n=0$, i.e., $(\ad{I}{x})^{m+n}=0$. So $\ad{}{x}$ is a nilpotent endomorphism in $  \gl L$. By Engel's theorem, $L$ is nilpotent.
\end{proof}

Now we can present a similar result the proposition \ref{0.6} but with a new proof using compatible pairs.

\begin{teo}{\label{1.8}} Let $K$ and $I$ be finite dimensional Lie algebras over a field of characteristic $p$ such that $K$ is nilpotent. Suppose that $K$ act on $I$ by representation $\psi:K \to \der I$. Let $(\alpha, \beta) \in \comp K I$ such that $\alpha$ has no eigenvalue 0. If either $p=0$ or $p>0$ and dimension of $I$ is less than $p$ then $Tr(\psi^n(k))=0$, for all $k \in K$. In these two cases, $\psi(k)$ is nilpotent. 
\end{teo}

\begin{proof} As $\alpha$ has no eigenvalue 0 then it is non-singular and by Proposition \ref{NonSDiag} $\alpha$ is diagonalizable. Let $x_1,...,x_s$ be a basis of $K$ such that $\alpha(x_i)=\lambda_i x_i$. For all $a \in \gl I$ denote by $[a]$ the matrix of $a$ in this base. Then $$[[\beta],[\psi(x_i)]]=\lambda_i[\psi(x_i)].$$ We can apply Proposition {\ref{1.2}} in this last equation for $A=\beta$, $B=\psi(x_{i})$, $C=0$ and  $\lambda=\lambda_i \neq 0$ to conclude that $\psi(x_i)$ is nilpotent for $1 \leq i \leq s$. Now we observe that if $K$ is a nilpotent Lie algebra in either characteristic is 0 or characteristic $p$ with dimension of $L$ less than $p$ then Lie theorem is valid. Lie theorem grants that there is a basis of $I$ such that all matrices of representation $\psi$ is upper triangular. Therefore, the matrices $[\psi(x_i)]$ are strictly upper triangular. Then all $\psi(k)$, for all $k \in K$, has only 0 in diagonal, because they are linear combination of $\psi(x_i)$. Hence every $\psi(k)$ is nilpotent.
\end{proof} 

\begin{cor}{\label{teo1.8cor}} Let $L$ be a solvable Lie algebra over a field $\F$ of characteristic $p$. Suppose that $L$ has a nonsingular derivation. If either $p=0$ or $p>0$ and dimension of $L^{(i)}/L^{(i+1)} <p$ then $L$ is nilpotent.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof} Suppose that $L \geq L^{(1)} \geq \cdots \geq L^{(k)} \geq L^{(k+1)}=0 $ is the derived series of $L$. Define $L_0=L$ and $L_i=L_{i-1}/L_{i-1}^{(k+1-i)}, 1 \leq i \leq k-1$. As each term of derived series are invariant by derivations then each $L_i$ has a non-singular derivation. In particular, $L_{k-1}$ is an solvable Lie algebra of derived length 2 with non-singular derivation. Then by theorem \ref{1.8} $\ad{}{k}$ is nilpotent for all $k \in L_{k-1}$ and by Proposition \ref{adnilp} $L_{k-1}$ is nilpotent. By induction we have that $L_i$ is nilpotent for every $0 \leq i \leq k-1$. Hence $L$ is nilpotent
\end{proof}
 
\section{Solvable non-nilpotent modular Lie algebras with non-singular derivations}

In this section we will describe the structure of some examples of solvable non-nilpotent modular Lie algebras $L$ with a non-singular derivation $d$. Based in this examples we will state some questions about this algebras. These issues will serve as a reference for further work.

 Let $V$ be a vector space and $x \in \gl V$. Denote the action of $x$ on $V$ by $\ad{}{x}(a)=[x,a]$, for all $a \in V$. A vector $a \in V$ is said to be $x$-cyclic if $$V=\langle a, \ad{}{x}(a), (\ad{}{x})^2(a), \cdots, (\ad{}{x})^{n-1}(a)\rangle.$$ The vector space $V$ is called $x$-cyclic if it has a $x$-cyclic vector. We can present some examples of Solvable non-nilpotent modular Lie algebras with non-singular derivations using cyclic spaces.
 
  \begin{ex}{\label{1.9}} Let $V$ be a vector space over a field $\F$ of characteristic $p>0$ and $x \in \gl V$.
  \begin{enumerate}
 \item Let $K$ be the vector space generated by $x$ over $\F$ and $I$ a subspace of $V$ of dimension $p$. Let $\{a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_p\}$ a base of $I$ such that $[x,a_i]=a_{i+1 mod p}$. As seen in Example \ref{mattareiex}, $L=K \sdsum I$ has a non-singular derivation;
 \item  Let $K$ be the vector space generated by $x$ over $\F$ and $I_1, I_2, \cdots, I_m$ be $x$-cyclic subspaces of $V$ of dimension $p$ such that $I_i \cap I_j=0$ for all $i \neq j$. Let $L$ be the Lie algebra $L= K \sdsum (I_1\oplus  \cdots \oplus I_m)$. Let $\lambda,\delta_1, \cdots, \delta_m $ be non-zero elements of $\F$ such that $\lambda \neq s \delta_i $, for all $s \in \F_p$; and $\{a_{i1}, \cdots a_{ip}\}$ a base of $I_i$ such that $[x,a_{ij}]=a_{i(j+1 modp)}$.  Define $d \in \gl L$ by $d(x)=\lambda x$ and $d(a_{ij})=(\delta_i+(j-1)\lambda)a_{ij}$. Then $d$ is a non-singular derivation of $L$.
 
 \item Let $K$ be the vector space generated by $\{x, x^2, \cdots, x^{p-1}\}$ over $\F$ and $I$ a $x$-cyclic subspace of dimension $p$. Let $L=K \sdsum I$. Let $\lambda,\delta \in \F$ both non-zero and $\lambda \neq s \delta $, for all $s \in \F_p$. Define the endomorphism $d \in \ennd {L}$ by $d(x^j)=j\lambda x^j,$ $ 1 \leq j \leq p-1$ and  $d(a_i)=(\delta +(i-1)\lambda)a_i,$ $ 1 \leq i \leq rp$, $d$ is a non-singular derivation of $L_1$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{ex} 
  
  All Lie algebras in Example \ref{1.9} are solvable, non-nilpotent, with non-singular derivation and they have derived length 2. For Lie algebras over fields of characteristic $p> 3$ we could not find an example of derived length greater than 3 but in characteristic 2 we have the following example.
  
\begin{ex} Let $L$ be a vector space of dimension 6 over $\F_4$. Let $\lambda \in \F_4$ such that $\lambda^2=\lambda+1$ and $\{a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4,a_5,a_6\}$ a basis of $L$ over $\F_4$. Define the products

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
$[a_1,a_3]=\lambda a_5+a_6,$ & $[a_1,a_4]=\lambda a_6,$ & $[a_1,a_5]=\lambda^2 a_3+a_4,$  & $[a_3,a_5]=\lambda a_2,$ \\
$[a_1,a_6]=\lambda^2 a_4 ,$  & $[a_2,a_3]=\lambda a_6,$ & and $[a_2,a_5]=\lambda^2 a_4.$ & \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}


 $L$ is a solvable non-nilpotent Lie algebra of derived length 3. The linear map $d: L \to L$ defined by $d(a_1)=a_1$, $d(a_2)=a_2$, $d(a_3)=\lambda a_3$, $d(a_4)=\lambda a_4$, $d(a_5)=\lambda^2 a_5$ and $d(a_6)=\lambda^2 a_6$ is a non-singular derivation of $L$.
\end{ex}  

With this examples we can state our first question:

\textbf{Problem 1.} Is there a solvable, non-nilpotent Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p>3$ with non-singular derivation and derived length greater than 2? 

Suppose that the answer to Problem 1 is yes and let $L$ be such Lie algebra. Let $I=L^{(2)}$ and $K=L/I$. As $L^{(3)}=0$ then $I$ is abelian and so $K$ acts on $I$ by adjoint representation. In this case, $K$ is a solvable Lie algebra of derived length 2 with non-singular derivation. By Proposition \ref{prop:cocic}, there is a cocycle $\vartheta \in \ztwo K I$ such that $L \cong K_{\vartheta}$. This calculation show us that every Lie algebra that answer Problem 1 can be obtained by an extension of a solvable Lie algebra of derived length 2 with non-singular derivation. So we need to understand this Lie algebras of derived length 2 to search for an answer of Problem 1. We will study a variation of this question.
  
\textbf{Problem 2.} Let $K$ be solvable, non-nilpotent Lie algebra over a field of characteristic $p>3$ with non-singular derivation and derived length 2. Is there a $K$-module $I$ and a cocycle $\vartheta \in \ztwo K I$ such that $K_\vartheta$ has a non-singular derivation? 

As first step to study Problem 2 we will try to describe some cases of abelian Lie algebras $K$ acting over vector spaces. Next we present some questions that we are working.

Let $x \in \gl V$ and $I$ a subspace of $V$ such that $L=\langle x \rangle \sdsum I$ has a non-singular derivation. 
\begin{itemize} 
\item In Example \ref{1.9}(2) $I$ can be decomposed in subspaces $I_j$ such that $\langle x \rangle \sdsum I_j$ has non-singular derivation. In general, can we define a smaller subspace of $J$ of $I$ such that $\langle x \rangle \sdsum J$ has non-singular derivation?   
\item How the existence of non-singular derivations affect the structure of $\der L$? Can we define some algebra structure over non-singular derivations of $L$? 
\end{itemize}
